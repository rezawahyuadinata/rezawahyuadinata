Hi, my name is Reza Wahyu Adinata, and I'm a software developer focusing on mobile and website. I have two years of experience, and I use tools like React and Flutter for development. I enjoy creating innovative and user-friendly apps that solve real-world problems. Some of my projects include a e-commerce, a books, and a company profile. Thank you for listening to my introduction.
